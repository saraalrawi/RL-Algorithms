# Experience

In order to solve the exercises we had to have a look at the book Chapter 6 and to the Slides from Lecture 5.
## Difficulty
The tasks seemed straightforward; For task one we had to implement the pseudo code from the RL Intro Books page 90/91. 
The results seam to be good but the unit tests didn't pass with the right values. After looking deeper we noticed we have to replace the G by content starting from the slides 33 of lecture 5. 
But also this didn't work well. So the time we needed increased more and more.
I would suggest to discuss the solution with the tutor, maybe he can address where we went wrong.

## Python on Mac
One of the team members is facing some challenges in python since he/she doesn’t come from python background rather than Java. However, the other team members are supportive and cooperative.

## Time 
The sheet required between 4-6h including meetings/discussions but this time with no perfect solution.
