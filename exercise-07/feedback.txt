7.1 Regret of UCB1 and Decaying Îµ-greedy (20p):

  (a)

  * The double-argmax in UCB1 is wrong. argmax(argmax(Q) + N) is not the same as
    argmax(Q+N). (-2.5p)
  * The rest looks good.
  
  (b)

  * You do not describe the problems that occur with the exploration strategies
    mentioned in the lecture. (-2.5p)
  * The 'sensor pattern check' is highly non-trivial and you did not descibe it
    very well. It corresponds to a mapping from sensor data to states to 
    security level. In addition, you had to know the next state, given an action
    and a sensor pattern (you cannot simply use the current sensor pattern,
    because the current sensor pattern corresponds to a safe state [otherwise
    we have a problem]).
