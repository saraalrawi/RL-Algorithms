Experience

In order to solve the exercises we had to have a look at the book Chapter 9, 10. 
Form our experience, David's lecture was not that helpful to understand the concepts. He got the topic twisted and did not manage the lecture's time very well.

Difficulty

The task  was not really understandable without help and at some point did not know what to ask. However, posting in the forum was helpful.
The code contains some errors and it took us sometime to realize the problematic part whether in our code or in yours. 
The Tensorflow is a huge toolbox and requirs a lot of time to get into it. We know that the task requires just few things to learn about TF, nevertheless, we think that the sheet could be formulated in a some other way due to the high required efforts. 
One of the team members faced additional challenges, that required to re-build the student's background. 
In order to get the code running/trained, the pool computer has been used.

Time
This sheet is the most difficult one so far it needed in average 16H (in the first week).

short comparison about your experiences with Q-learning – with and without experience replay and target networks:
First we collected episodes with done and started to replay them at the point we have batch_size episodes. By nature this is better
than further random because it only trains with working runs. If this wouldn't suitable another batch_size would be possible to change.
